## Project Explanation

The following project demonstartes how JavaScript can be used to manipulate elements within the DOm and add HTML or manipulate HTML to add effects to an otherwise static site. The following site is a landing page that is filled with four sections. While the HTML and CSS aspects look nice, they need JavaScript to add features such as the navigation bar that allows you to go to differing sections, noting what current article the user is on and adding a highlighted color to let the user know what article they are on and also the implementation of the smooth scrolling feature. This project demonstrates how DOm elements can be modified and changed via JavaScript in an elegant way.

## Instructions
To use the site, all you have to do is navigate to the root of the folder and press the index.html file and you should be good to go. 

## Credits
The HTML and CSS aspects of the4 code were provided to me via UDacity and all of that code was written by the UDacity team. The JavaScript aspect was fully written by me (Eshaq Jamdar).
